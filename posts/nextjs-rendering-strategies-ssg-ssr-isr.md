Next.js Is Trending â€” Because of itâ€™s built-in feature like SSG, SSR, or ISR but the question is when to use?
One of the biggest reasons for its popularity its powerful rendering strategies:

- ðŸ”¹ SSG (Static Site Generation)
- ðŸ”¹ SSR (Server-Side Rendering)
- ðŸ”¹ ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)

By Proper understanding of it when to use which strategy can make better performance and user experience. Here's a detailed breakdown with some real-world examples to help choose wisely:

### ðŸ”¹ SSG (Static Site Generation)

When to Use It:

Best For: Content that doesn't change frequently, such as blogs, marketing/landing pages, documentation sites, portfolios, and e-commerce product listings with stable data.<br/>

Why It's Great: Pages are pre-rendered into static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files at build time. This means the server doesn't need to do any work on each request, leading to lightning-fast load times. These static files can be easily served from a CDN, making them highly cacheable, resilient, and cost-effective.

How It Works:

Next.js pre-renders pages using `getStaticProps` (for data fetching) and getStaticPaths (for dynamic routes). Once built, the HTML files are ready to be served directly to the user.

ðŸ’¡ Real-world Example:

Think of Landing/homepage, these data are not changed frequently. These pages are designed to be extremely fast and reliable. Their content changes infrequently, making SSG the ideal choice for delivering a blazing-fast initial load and excellent SEO. Imagine reading a blog post â€“ you want it to appear instantly, and SSG delivers just that.

### ðŸ”¹ SSR (Server-Side Rendering)

When to Use It:

- Best For: Highly dynamic content, user-specific data, authentication-gated pages, real-time applications, and situations where data needs to be fresh on every request. Examples include user dashboards, social media feeds, and search results pages.
- Why It's Great: Content is generated on each request on the server. This allows you to fetch the latest data and personalize the content for the specific user, ensuring they always see up-to-date information. It's perfect when SEO is important for dynamic content.

How It Works:

Next.js uses `getServerSideProps` to fetch data on every incoming request to the server. The server then renders the HTML with the fetched data and sends it to the client.

ðŸ’¡ Real-world Example:

Consider your LinkedIn feed. When you log in, you expect to see your recent activity, or connections' latest posts. This content is unique to you and changes constantly. SSR ensures that every time you refresh the page, you get the most current and relevant data, providing a truly real-time and personalized experience.

### ðŸ”¹ ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)

When to Use It:

- Best For: Pages that benefit from the speed of static generation but also require periodic updates to their content. This is ideal for e-commerce product pages, news articles, content-heavy sites that update regularly, and dynamic but SEO-friendly pages.

- Why It's Great: ISR offers a powerful hybrid approach. It generates pages at build time (like SSG) but allows them to be `revalidated` and regenerated in the background after a specified time interval (or on demand) without requiring a full site rebuild. This provides the speed of static content while ensuring reasonable data freshness.

How It Works:

With `getStaticProps`, you add a revalidate property. When a request comes in for a page that's older than the revalidate time, the stale page is served instantly while Next.js regenerates the new version in the background. Subsequent requests will then receive the fresh version.

ðŸ’¡ Real-world Example:

Think of Amazon product pages or Medium articles. You want these pages to load incredibly fast for a good user experience and SEO. However, product prices, stock levels, or article comments can change frequently. ISR allows Amazon to serve a static, fast version of the product page, and then update it in the background if, for example, the price changes. This way, users get a fast initial load, and the content remains reasonably up-to-date without the need for frequent full site deployments.

Choosing the right rendering strategy is crucial for optimizing Next.js application's performance, user experience, and scalability. By understanding the strengths of SSG, SSR, and ISR, you can make informed decisions that lead to more efficient and powerful web applications.
