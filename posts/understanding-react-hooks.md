# Understanding React Hooks

React Hooks have revolutionized how we write React components. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore the most important hooks and how to use them effectively.

## useState: Managing Component State

The `useState` hook is the foundation of state management in functional components. Here's how to use it:

```javascript
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
```

### Common Use Cases

- Form inputs
- Toggle states
- Counter implementations
- UI state management

## useEffect: Handling Side Effects

The `useEffect` hook helps manage side effects in your components:

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  document.title = `Count: ${count}`;
}, [count]);
```

### Key Points

- Runs after every render
- Can specify dependencies
- Cleanup function for unmounting

## useContext: Managing Global State

Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without prop drilling:

```javascript
const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
```

## Custom Hooks

Create reusable logic by building custom hooks:

```javascript
function useWindowSize() {
  const [size, setSize] = useState([window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight]);
  // Implementation
  return size;
}
```

## Best Practices

1. Always name hooks with 'use' prefix
2. Only call hooks at the top level
3. Use multiple hooks for different concerns
4. Keep hooks simple and focused

## Conclusion

React Hooks provide a more elegant way to reuse stateful logic and manage component lifecycle. By understanding these fundamental hooks, you can write more maintainable and efficient React applications."}}}
