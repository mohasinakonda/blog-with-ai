# Getting Started with TypeScript

TypeScript is a powerful superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the language. Let's explore some basic concepts!

## Why TypeScript?

TypeScript offers several benefits:

- Static typing
- Better IDE support
- Enhanced code maintainability
- Improved team collaboration

## Basic Types

```typescript
// Number
let age: number = 25;

// String
let name: string = "John Doe";

// Boolean
let isStudent: boolean = true;

// Array
let numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```

## Interfaces

Interfaces are one of TypeScript's most powerful features:

```typescript
interface User {
	name: string;
	age: number;
	email?: string; // Optional property
}

const user: User = {
	name: "John Doe",
	age: 25,
};
```

Start using TypeScript in your next project to write more maintainable code!
