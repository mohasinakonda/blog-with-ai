# Introduction to Next.js

Next.js is a powerful React framework that makes building full-stack web applications simple and efficient. Let's explore its key features!

## Why Next.js?

Next.js provides several advantages:

- Server-side rendering (SSR)
- Static site generation (SSG)
- API routes
- File-system based routing
- Built-in image optimization

## Getting Started

```bash
# Create a new Next.js project
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
cd my-app

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

## Basic Routing

Next.js uses a file-system based router. Files in the `app` directory automatically become routes:

```typescript
// app/page.tsx - Home page (/)
export default function Home() {
	return <h1>Welcome to Next.js!</h1>;
}

// app/about/page.tsx - About page (/about)
export default function About() {
	return <h1>About Us</h1>;
}
```

Start building your next project with Next.js for a great developer experience!
